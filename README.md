**"Top-20-Ideas"**!

The concept is simple but unique: anyone can visit, browse through different ideas, and **like** or **dislike** them. Want to add your own idea? You can do that tooâ€”**no account required**! Iâ€™ve designed it to keep things as user-friendly as possible.

Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™m building it:

- Using **React + Vite** to create a fast and responsive frontend.
- **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** are my go-to tools for clean and modern styling.
- For storing all the ideas, Iâ€™m using **Drizzle ORM** with a **Neon database** on the backend.
- Iâ€™m also using **localStorage** to make sure users canâ€™t like or dislike the same idea multiple times.

The goal is to make it super easy for anyone to share and rate ideas without the hassle of signing up. Letâ€™s see where this project goes! ðŸ˜„
